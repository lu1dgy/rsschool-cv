## About myself:

I enrolled in the world of web programming in the summer of 2022 and decided to be a frontend developer, because it was attractive for me to see representation of my work. It makes me satisfied. I know how important the details are for a Frontend Developer. My keen attention to detail and dedication to solving any problem are my best qualities. But sometimes it's really hard for me to stop, when I have unsolved code problem!

## Code example:

**CamelCase Method from CODEWARS:**
Write simple .camelCase method for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

```
String.prototype.camelCase = function() {
  let str = this.split(' ')
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i]) {
      str[i] = str[i][0].toUpperCase() + str[i].slice(1)
    }
  }
  return str.join('')
}
```
